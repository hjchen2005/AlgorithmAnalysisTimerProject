<h2>Software Documentations</h2>
<p>Developer: Hanjun Chen</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
I created a Java program for running different algorithms. The library I used for this project is JDK 8u66. In the program, I used a timer (defined in src/Timer/ArrayTimer.java) to calculate the running time of each algorithm, and print the total time used for running the algorithm, along with the k-th element that the algorithm finds. Each algorithm will run 100 times.</p>

<h3>algorithm package</h3>
<p>
The algorithms I selected are Merge sort, Quick sort, K-Selection, Randomized selection, and Tournament tree, respectively.</p>

<h3>algorithm.randomizedSelections package</h3>
<p>
Including a template (RandomizedSelections.java), and Div3, Div5 classes that implement the template. Known issues: after testing a small sample input array, I decided that the algorithms do not work.

<h3>Test classes</h3>
<p>
Test classes for each algorithm, individually located in separate packages: src/kSelection, src/mergeSort, src/quickSort, src/randomizedSelection and src/TournamentTree. They are named (packageName)Test.java, with packageName being the respective directory each test class located in. Every test class has an entry point, where users can run them as Java Applications.

<h3>
test.(algorithmName) packages</h3>
<p>
Almost identical to the test classes. They are intended for small outputs, just for testing the correctness of the corresponding algorithms.

<h3>timer package</h3>
ArrayDistinctElements class
<ul>
<li>arrayRandom: a static array of integers</li>
<li>arraySize: a static integer, equals 1,000,000. Used for defining input arrays.</li>
<li>randomFill(0)  method: returns a random integer.</li>
<li>List(0) method: returns an array of integers.</li>
<li>Print(0) method: prints every element of an array. For test purpose only, never used in any test classes.</li>
</ul>
ArrayTimer class
<ul>
<li>Start(0): start the timer.</li>
<li>Stop(0): stop the timer.</li>
<li>GetElapsedTime(0): returns the difference between start and end times. The unit is milliseconds.</li>
</ul>

<h3>outPutForAnalysis package</h3>
ChartVisual class
<ul>
<li>chartCreation(2): 
reads input from a file (in the case of this program, also the output file generated by outputForAnalysis.Outputs
Download here: https://bitbucket.org/snippets/dylanch/8L5LB) by receiving a File variable as a parameter and scans into an ArrayList<Double>, 
and then creates the chart out of the data from the ArrayList, and create a bar chart displaying the static running time of a 
certain algorithm. Works perfectly
</li>
<li>
liveComparison(2): 
for adding comparison count to an ArrayList<Integer>, returns the ArrayList<Integer>. works.
Example: 
	input: an array of 1000000 ints, loop 99 times; 
	Algorithm: merge sort
	Output: 299999700 counts
</li>
<li>
liveChart(2): 
for displaying real time increment of comparisons. 
Compiles, but doesn't work due to exceeding java heap capacity, exceptions thrown. 
</li></ul>

<h3>jQGraphicModule class</h3>
QueryTableApp class: Provides graphing software that can take in a series of numbers and graph them into 3 different types of charts. Design for ine graph is finished, other functions are still under construction. Notice: it is designed for ploting real time comparison counts of an algorithm, however, such functionalities are not designed yet.
